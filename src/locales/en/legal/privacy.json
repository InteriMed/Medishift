Internet platforms can fall under the definition of a \"placeur\" if their activities meet these criteria. An activity is generally considered \"régulièrement\" (regularly) if there is an intention to offer such services repeatedly or if it occurs at least ten times within twelve months. \"Contre rémunération\" (against remuneration) is broadly defined and includes any payment whose cause is the placement, even the reimbursement of expenses.\nInterimed does not enter into employment contracts with Seekers, either directly or on behalf of Providers. Furthermore, the Platform does not lease the services of Seekers to Providers, nor does it assume or transfer the essential powers of direction over a Seeker's work to a Provider in a manner that would constitute service leasing under the LSE. Any fees charged by Interimed are for the provision and use of its technological infrastructure, software tools, and intermediary services, and not as a commission for successful placement or for leasing personnel as defined by the LSE and its related ordinances (e.g., OEmol-LSE regarding fees and commissions).\nAny contractual relationship, whether an employment contract, a mandate, or any other form of service agreement, is formed strictly and directly between the Seeker and the Provider. The Platform is not a party to such agreements. This distinction is critical, as activities qualifying as placement or service leasing under the LSE are subject to specific authorization requirements, financial guarantees (sureties), and operational obligations, from which the Platform, by its nature as a technology intermediary, is distinct."

Users, such as Providers (e.g., pharmacies), have the ability to use these templates, adjust them, or add their own sections or entirely new contracts for the purpose of engaging with Seekers.Disclaimer: Interimed acts solely as a facilitator providing these tools. We are not a party to any contract entered into between Users. We do not provide legal advice, and the provision of contract templates does not constitute legal advice or an endorsement of their suitability for any specific purpose. Users are solely and entirely responsible for the content, legality, and enforceability of any contracts they create, modify, or agree to using the Platform's functionalities, including the e-signature service. We expressly disclaim any liability or responsibility for the terms, conditions, accuracy, completeness, or legal effect of any user-generated or user-modified contract content. Users should seek independent legal counsel to ensure any contract meets their specific requirements and complies with all applicable laws. Our processing of personal data contained within such contracts is solely for the purpose of providing the contract management and e-signature services as instructed by the Users involved."

This ensures a consistent legal framework for the operation of the Platform and the protection of data processed by us. This does not affect the contractual obligations solely between Users, to which we are not a party."

                "content": "When a contract facilitated through the Platform is validated and subsequently cancelled, a cancellation fee may be charged in accordance with the terms specified in the contract between the Users or in our Terms of Service if the fee pertains to Platform services. The calculation of this fee may depend on factors such as the timing of the cancellation relative to the contract start date. A minimum advance notice period for cancellation without incurring the full extent of such fees (e.g., 24 hours) may be stipulated.The processing of personal data related to the calculation, notification, and collection of cancellation fees (including Identity Data, Contact Data, Contract Data, and Financial Data) is undertaken for the purpose of enforcing contractual terms and collecting sums due. The legal basis for this processing is typically the Performance of a Contract (the agreed terms of cancellation) and our Overriding Legitimate Interest in recovering duly owed fees. Retention of these records will follow the principles outlined in Section XI, typically for 10 years if forming part of accounting records."
