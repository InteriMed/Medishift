Your overall approach MUST emulate the design philosophy of Claude. You must check the code and apply repairs as first intention, not generate lines of codes (AI slope content) when this can be avoided.

## STYLING
Always use the styling variables stored in [variables.css](mdc:src/styles/variables.css).
Use the components stored in [boxedInputFields](mdc:src/components/boxedInputFields/) folder: Button.js, personnalizedInputField.js, SimpleDropdown.js, TextareaField.js, etc.

src/config must centralize all access routes when possible
