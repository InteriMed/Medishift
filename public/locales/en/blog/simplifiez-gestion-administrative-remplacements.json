        "The administrative management of temporary staff represents a considerable challenge for Swiss pharmacies. This time-consuming process involves a multitude of tasks: searching for candidates, verifying qualifications, managing contracts, tracking timesheets, adjusting payroll, and ensuring legal compliance.",
        "These tasks are added to an already substantial administrative burden for pharmacies, which must handle the establishment's secretarial work, participate in the billing process, process orders, manage inventory, and draft various pharmaceutical documents.",
        "According to a recent survey, administrative simplification is indeed the primary expectation of human resources directors in the healthcare sector, highlighting a pressing need to which temporary staff management adds another layer of complexity."

        "Manual management of temporary staff exposes pharmacies to several risks and inefficiencies that can have significant consequences:",
        "• Potential errors in payroll and compliance processes, which can lead to legal or financial complications",
        "• Considerable time consumed by administrative staff, which could be allocated to higher value-added tasks such as patient counseling",
        "• Difficulty in obtaining a clear overview of the use and costs of temporary staff, complicating budget planning",
        "• Challenges in ensuring that all temporary staff comply with specific regulatory requirements for each canton",
        "Navigating cantonal regulations for temporary healthcare staff proves particularly complex. For example, the authorization process for replacements in the canton of Vaud involves several specific steps, with variable documentary requirements, while the canton of Valais has its own rules regarding the presence of pharmacists."
