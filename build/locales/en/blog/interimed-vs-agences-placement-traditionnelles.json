        "Swiss pharmacies needing temporary staff have traditionally turned to placement agencies to fill their human resource needs. These intermediaries have long been the default solution, despite their well-known limitations in terms of cost, responsiveness, and transparency.",
        "The emergence of digital platforms like InteriMed® represents an innovative alternative that is disrupting this established model. This evolution is part of a broader trend of digital transformation in the healthcare sector, where efficiency and resource optimization are becoming strategic priorities.",
        "Faced with this choice, pharmacies must objectively evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each approach to determine the solution that best meets their specific temporary staffing needs."

        "To help pharmacies make an informed choice, here is a point-by-point comparison between traditional placement agencies and InteriMed®:",
        "**Costs:**",
        "• Traditional agencies: High commission fees, often between 20% and 40% of the annual salary for permanent recruitment. For temporary staff, a multiplier of around 1.40 is applied to the hourly rate, representing a significant margin.",
        "• InteriMed®: Transparent pricing model based on reduced service fees, allowing overall savings of 30 to 50% compared to traditional agencies.",
        "**Speed and Efficiency:**",
        "• Traditional agencies: Often slow processes involving multiple intermediaries, with average delays of 2 to 4 weeks to find a suitable candidate.",
        "• InteriMed®: Direct and immediate access to a database of available professionals, allowing a need to be filled in a few hours or a few days depending on urgency.",
        "**Transparency:**",
        "• Traditional agencies: Often opaque pricing, limited choice of candidates presented, little visibility into the selection process.",
        "• InteriMed®: Complete and verified profiles, real-time visibility of availability and rates, direct communication with professionals.",
        "**Control and Flexibility:**",
        "• Traditional agencies: Little control over the selection process, dependence on the agency for communication with candidates.",
        "• InteriMed®: Total autonomy to browse and select candidates who best match the specific needs and culture of the pharmacy.",
        "This disintermediation of the staffing process offers pharmacies more direct control, greater transparency, and potentially better financial results by eliminating the intermediary's margin."
