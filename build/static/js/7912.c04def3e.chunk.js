This situation, although rarely publicized, constitutes a major challenge for pharmacies, which often find themselves helpless in the face of this lack of human resources.","According to data from pharmaSuisse (Swiss Pharmacists\' Society), the staff shortage in pharmacies requires the urgent deployment of measures at several levels to ensure the continuity and quality of care. This shortage is statistically more marked among pharmacists, with an index of 8.2, exceeding that of all health specialists (7.8).","Several factors contribute to this critical situation: demographic changes with an aging population requiring more pharmaceutical care, a sociological evolution where young professionals seek a better work-life balance, and a growing dependence on foreign diplomas to fill vacant positions."],"image":"https://www.corporatevision-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/time-saving.jpg","imageCaption":"Swiss pharmacies face unprecedented recruitment challenges"},{"title":"Consequences of the Shortage and Limits of Current Approaches: Beyond the Numbers","paragraphs":["This shortage creates concrete daily difficulties for pharmacies: arduous searches for replacements for planned or unforeseen absences, workload overload for existing teams, increased risk of professional burnout, and potential impact on service quality and pharmacy opening hours.","An aggravating factor is the aging workforce: 37% of practice authorizations are held by pharmacists aged 56 and over, heralding a significant wave of retirements that will intensify the shortage. Growing recruitment difficulties are a tangible reality for employers.","The high proportion of new diplomas registered by MEBEKO from abroad (62% in 2023) can be seen as a short-term solution, but it potentially masks shortcomings in the Swiss training system and raises ethical questions about the \'brain drain\' from other nations.","Although the shortage is a national problem, regional variations exist. For example, it is in eastern Switzerland that the proportion of vacant positions is highest for pharmacy assistants. This data indicates significant market potential in different Swiss regions, where a scalable digital solution could effectively meet these localized and acute needs."]},{"title":"InteriMed\xae as a Breath of Fresh Air: The Digital and Flexible Solution","paragraphs":["Faced with these structural challenges, InteriMed\xae positions itself as an innovative SaaS platform, designed to quickly and efficiently connect pharmacies with qualified and available healthcare professionals for temporary assignments.","The key advantages of InteriMed\xae for pharmacies are multiple:","\u2022 Access to a pool of verified pharmacists and pharmacy assistants, available for short-term or urgent needs","\u2022 Simplified search and booking process, contrasting with often time-consuming traditional methods","\u2022 Increased transparency regarding availability and rates","\u2022 Ability for pharmacies to maintain service continuity while efficiently managing their staff\'s workload","This approach is in line with the digital transformation dynamic of the Swiss healthcare system, promoted by initiatives like DigiSant\xe9, which aim to modernize healthcare operations.
