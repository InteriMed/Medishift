These impressive figures include not only direct costs but also often overlooked indirect costs.","A concrete example illustrates this reality: an employer may pay an agency CHF 43.44 gross/hour for a qualified employee, while the candidate only receives CHF 31.03 gross/hour. This significant difference represents the agency\'s margin and constitutes a considerable additional cost for healthcare facilities, particularly in a context where commercial margins are already under pressure."],"image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1554224155-6726b3ff858f?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1200&q=80","imageCaption":"The hidden costs of recruitment weigh heavily on pharmacy finances"},{"title":"Beyond Agency Fees - The Invisible Costs and Their Impacts","paragraphs":["Agency fees represent only the tip of the iceberg.

In a sector where trust and customer relationships are paramount, these impacts can have long-term consequences on reputation and customer loyalty."]},{"title":"MediShift\xae: The Smart Alternative for Pharmacy Staffing","paragraphs":["Faced with these financial and organizational challenges, MediShift\xae positions itself as an innovative and economical solution for Geneva healthcare facilities.
